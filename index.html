<h2>Why do we forget things?</h2>
<p>Don't you forget things all the time? Have you ever wondered why you forget things or how not to forget. Don't worry, I have a technique to improve your memory. Before attempting to improve your memory, it is important to understand why we forget things in the first place. Lets take an example. Have you ever encountered a scenario when you were unsure if you have locked the car? Assuming you did lock the car, the problem is that you don't seem to remember doing it. The reason that you don't remember is because this is a natural thing for you, that you lock the car automatically. If you don't think of that moment then you don't remember that event. The key here is to think it as a thought. If you don't think while doing it, you don't remember doing it.</p>
